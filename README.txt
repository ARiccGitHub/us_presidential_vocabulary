Overview:

Newspapers and their online formats supply the public with the information we need to understand the events occurring in the world around us. 
From politics to sports, the news keeps us informed, in the loop, and ready to make decisions about how to act in a rapidly changing world.
Given the vast amount of news articles in circulation, identifying and organizing articles by topic is a useful activity. 
This can help you sift through the enormous amount of information out there so you can find the news relevant to your interests, or even allow you to build a news recommendation engine!
Whenever a United States of America president is elected or re-elected, an inauguration ceremony takes place to mark the beginning of the president’s term. During the ceremony, the president gives an inaugural address to the nation, dictating the tone and focus of the next four years of leadership.

In this project you will have the chance to analyze the inaugural addresses of the presidents of the United States of America, as collected by the Natural Language Toolkit, using word embeddings.

By training sets of word embeddings on subsets of inaugural address versus the collection of presidents as a whole, we can learn about the different ways in which the presidents use language to convey their agenda.
